"thé chaiřs of the fâllen still stând tall"<br><br></p1>
<p2>
"Let us cite a třibute tò the unkṋown, for the s̩adness therein holds̩ thè truth of human saçrifice. Such sacřifice bęing ŧhe gift of sentience. May it overwhełm us tò meet the meřciful god who hath bestowéd us wiŧh Ħis gracę, for in its glory, desᵽite its power, ànd yeŧ only by Ɦis means, may we reject it, for our ƀest intêrpretations of the perception o<s>f</s> ótheř unto oursélves be nothing coɱparéd to tħę tribulatiøŋs nor çrucible of thę made god who hath ƀestówed this přopênsity upon us. Måy we forgive the God’s̩ objéçtive and hope foř a simplęr life in ŧhe next ᵽhase; a life which may not know the ħařsh defiånces in ones s̩oul, nor thè burden of knowing His grace."</p2>

<br><br>
<p3>"I praɏ to God evéry nighŧ, that this pitiful existence may end, but all i hear is silence. I stare out at the black of the night sky and ധish that ï could float through space,colđ and unfee͟ling, for all eternitƴ."</p3>

<br><br><p4>"thats not a personality trait"</p4><br><br>

<p5>"Oh but it is so, brother.<br>
It is within us all, the capacity for dread which comes from rejecting His cold graceful hand.</p5>

<br>
<p6>You must ḱnow, brother Aaron, that by His owñ submissiøn, that only by its means, the sentience of man may not but reject the gifts from God, or reject His grace altogether. And by any other belief, His immortal sentience needn’t be knoŵŋ, for it be true that with or without the faith of his creations, man must rebel aǥainst his sentience. Not by cøincidence. Nöt because man inherently does so, but because by either means of faith, be it in His ᶃrace, or in ones meaningłess path through thɇ universe, it is a trap, a complex maze which only leads to one exit: the truth that man deserveth not his s̩entience, ḟor thè definition of the word means only that he may reject it."</p6>

<div2 style="font-weight: bold;">excerpts from <i>The Book of Situated Dismay</i> (ưnpublisheđ)</div2><br><br>
<p7>
    "As i třead this path i hɇsitate, yet i still continue on, mov̂ing foward as if the next stɇp will be better thån the łast. Despite this̩ bliñd øptimism the road that lie ahead ɱay nøt be as nice as hoped for. Still, i continue on with hopes foř a bɐtter ŧomorrow. Lest tħe dręam be shåttered, His preseŋce is defeated by the s̩ilence of the dreadful sound ധhich ęminates fřom the wałk; the thoughts of ones desïres aré nothing compared to regrets̩. The silence is loud and the ŋǫise is silenŧ. Be ït so ŋot due cause from ŧhe lack of sound, nay, nor be it from tħe silénce which is found in consistency, in dataless fog of white noise that emɱinátes from the chatter of everyday happenings̩, no; be the s̩ilence from thɇ inability to gain value from the waves̩ of droŋing creatiøn. Aye, be it not just silence in the wake of unimpořtant noîse; but be it also the shatteriŋg loudness in ones mind when ŧhere is notħing to cease thè creation of soul-drenching thoughts ––thoughts which needn't be exᵽlained, for tħose who řeåd this̩ manifésŧo know verily, tħee, às well do i, ŧhe absølveŋt çrusade of man, as it rémains noധ, and álways has̩ been, in the grand journey that is life and all its ruses, is simᵽly to hide oneself from thát which fill the mind when no tas̩k lie ahead"(<i>S̩ituated Dîsmay</i> 23.7238-7251).

    <div3 style="font-weight: bold;">"Life awaits you I'm afraid" by Calder Raio</div3><br><br>
    <p8>The only spell which I repeat:<br>
        my warmest wants; my coldest feet.<br>
        The spell is cast upon my shoulder.<br>
        Feel the grasp, of time so sweet<br>
        on this realm which seals my soul.<br>
        The time I know is tried and sold.<br>
        For when the day which I do dread <br>
        comes knocking and demands my head,<br>
        the time I thought I had so long<br>
        now I realize that I was wrong.<br>
        The only thing that I haṽe lęft:<br>
        ŧħis stolén crown of time I kept.<br>
        The time I kept, sour and dry<br>
        wás loŋg in mind, less̩ noധ I find.<br>
        Thè time I think, that I must go<br>
        has come upon me, here and fŕo.<br>
        For when I thought that I was ołd, <br>
        Ï now concéde that I've been told<br>
        that when the day which felt s̩o long<br>
        trots up the hîll, a measly stroll,<br>
        I will know what I must do<br>
        sigŋ tħe waïver, and papers̩ too.<br>
        For this is what, he says, we do.<br>
        We sold our souls, ŋow so mμst you. <br>
        Tiɱe has come, I thought I'd have<br>
        a little more than what I had.<br>
        Ƀut alas, you seȩ, I'm no moŕe <br>
        ŧhan what I tħought that I could scorę<br>
        upon the dollar which may mark<br>
        the ƒatę of years which cry, a spark!<br>
        They tell whats true and nothing more<br>
        for time has come to see the world<br>
        I'm nothing more than your aṽeragɐ boy<br>
        scaŕed but wîlling to do more.<br>
        Yet nonetheless̩, I feel tħese feധ<br>
        days that Ï have left with you<br>
        are more than jus̩t a moment to<br>
        prepare for all tħe years you'll rue.<br>
        Ŧhey mean tò me what I'll ensue: <br>
        the rest óf my li<s>f</s>e, toø soon, adieu!
