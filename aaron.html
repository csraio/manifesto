    <div style="text-indent: 1cm;">Dear Mr. whoever this may concern, </div><br><br>


School has been an important role in every kids life which is why it is important to make the best experience possible for students. lets go over some key points that we would think would make for a better school environment for everyone for instance less homework better teaching and especially the grading system.<br><br>
    Homework has been a major part of kids' education, and to be honest what has homework actually done. Sure it’s fine to give homework if the student did not finish something but even so is important where it gets in the way of a student's free time. Aaron a “student” at northport high and a writer of this documentary says, “When I do my homework, I do not enjoy myself and tend to urinate more often than not” Aaron 1670-2025<br><br>
This shows how children 8 and under are struggling with the homework epidemic wiping through this proud nation of ours. My dad can't do his own laundry. So now that we're done with the homework segment ill hand it over to Joe Castlehazoe.<br><br>
As the Sage of the Six Paths said “you will feel true pain soon enough." Sage of the Six Paths 2007-2017. An educated man that has gone unnamed once said “Stanky fishy stanky fishy.”An educated man that has gone unnamed 2-3. When I walk in class I get so irrationally angry I could probably single handedly rip an orangutan in half with my own bare hands. All the teachers do is sit there and speak to my face like i'm actually supposed to care meanwhile i'm sitting there about to fall asleep because school starts at a ridiculously early hours and since im a teenager who wants to have friends and a social life I tend to stay up late so when I have to wake up at 6 to do my fucking homework because I sure as hell don't do it after school because thats when all my friends get on so instead of being a social outcast im going to play with them.<br><br>
"You bitch." Nmazz 2009-2002. This quote shows the district's failure to properly educate children and their pure ignorance to the situation they're in.<br><br>
Here's another problem with school. When I walk into school my day goes from "man I just woke up four minutes ago and I'm not ready to learn useless information" to "man my testosterone level is so low my body might start to fail on me." The problem is there's no goddamn motive to go to school, seriously it's awful how much I don't Want to go to school.<br><br>
Aaron<br><br>
As Gandhi once said "in a gentle way, you can shake the world" Gandhi 200 B.C.-???. I don't know what this proves but it makes me laugh because Gandhi is spelt weird.<br><br>
The problem with school is that most of the information that we are taught is useless. As the Fuhrer once said “The art of reading and studying consists in remembering the essentials and forgetting what is not essential.”Adolf Hitler 900/900. I think we should take these words to heart, as well as some of his other teachings.<br><br>
Now let's take the time to go through every subject in school to further extend this article so I can pass my english class<br><br>
Language- language is the most useless class you will probably take throughout your educational career. "Il socialismo è una frode, una commedia, un fantasma, un ricatto." Mussolini 9/11/01. This shows how we should respect our elders more.<br><br>
History- This subject shows us how the past was better than the present. I’d honestly rather be a poor British person living in the slums of London drinking from the fucking sewer pipes than be in class for one more minute. “If I were a person of Indian-German descent I’d probably die young” Joan of Arc 3033-0.<br><br>
Math- In math class all I do is snooze, try as you might but I have news for you I couldn't give any less shits if I tried. Let's think about this for a minute who give a flying fuck about how tall a tower is and how big of a shadow its casts. Not like it really matters anyway because I only have a few quibis to live “God has entered my body, like a body my same size, like me floating into you, or you floating into me” Bob Hickman 666-999<br><br>
<a href="joe.html" >English- English kinda boring tbh</a> “six trigrams sixty four palms” Neggie 2007-2016 i smell bad<br><br>
Lunch- lunch is my favorite period and I swear it's not because I'm fat. It's the only time in the day I get to converge with my fellow peers and vape in the bathroom. I also bring bagged lunch so I don't get cancer from the school lunches. Little do the buyers know they slowly poison you until 12th grade and finally finish you off by sending you to college. “<br><br>
