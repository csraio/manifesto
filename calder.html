<div style="font-weight: bold;">"Life awaits you I'm afraid" by Calder Raio</div>
    <p>The only spell which I repeat:<br>
        my warmest wants; my coldest feet.<br>
        The spell is cast upon my shoulder.<br>
        Feel the grasp, of time so sweet<br>
        on this realm which seals my soul.<br>
        The time I know is tried and sold.<br>
        For when the day which I do dread <br>
        comes knocking and demands my head,<br>
        the time I thought I had so long<br>
        realize that I was wrong.<br>
        The only thing that I have left:<br>
        this stolen crown of time I kept.<br>
        The time I kept, sour and dry<br>
        was long in mind, less now I find.<br>
        The time I think, that I must go<br>
        has come upon me, here and fro.<br>
        For when I thought that I was old, <br>
        I now concede that I've been told<br>
        that when the day which felt so long<br>
        trots up the hill, a measly stroll,<br>
        I will know what I must do<br>
        sign the waiver, and papers too.<br>
        For this is what, he says, we do.<br>
        We sold our souls, now so must you. <br>
        Time has come, I thought I'd have<br>
        a little more than what I had.<br>
        But alas, you see, I'm no more <br>
        than what I thought that I could score<br>
        upon the dollar which may mark<br>
        the fate of years which cry, a spark!<br>
        They tell whats true and nothing more<br>
        for time has come to see the world<br>
        I'm nothing more than your average boy<br>
        scared but willing to do more.<br>
        Yet nonetheless, I feel these few<br>
        days that I have, left with you<br>
        are more than just a moment to<br>
        prepare for all the years you'll rue.<br>
        They mean to me what I'll ensue: <br>
        the rest of my life, too soon, adieu!<br>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">When Your Phone Dies At Night</div><br>
    <p2>
        Heh. It’s funny, staring into the face of darkness— the black void of space and the dark room will suddenly fill my senses all at once and the sheer contrast between experiences is like no other completely mundane experience there is. At the moment I have my noise cancelling headphones in but I’m not listening to anything so I’m experiencing almost nothing save the light coming from my phone. When my phone finally gives in to the void I will be left in a room with much more stimulation that I had before: there will be noise from the air conditioner. There will be light from behind the crack between the door and the floor. I’ll be able to see what’s happening in the room around me. And yet, it’ll seem like the world has gone dark, despite in fact doing the opposite. No more people to talk to. No way to know what’s happening at home. No way to even know what time it is. No alarm to wake me up in the morning. I’ll take my headphones off and I’ll hear the noise of the plastic and padding rubbing past my ears. The world seems so much bleaker than it is when your phone dies at night. This tiny black box in my hands connecting my brain to the rest of the world, unplugged from my skull suddenly and violently. Tiny black box. Heh. That’s all it is. It feels good to think of it that way. Like an old MP3 player or something. Sansa Clip with Rockbox is no different than the metal with firmware I hold in my hands. Yet I take this machine for granted unlike many others of its variety. Its what we have that we ignore. Always what we once had or what we might have in the future that sparks our eyes. Some might say that’s a bad thing but I think it’s what has kept the human race going all these years. Millennia of traveling and exploring, venturing out into the vast and unforgiving ocean simply becuase we wanted more. It was foolish, yes. It was a suicide mission, yes. But in the end it got us to new land and thrusted the whole lot of us into a new age. One where the human race became more than the individual. We now operate as an organism of other organisms. Just as the singular human body only functions symbiotically with the millions of microorganisms and bacteria in our guts, the human race functions as one organism comprised of many. Humans are the bacteria which individually live inconsequential lives. But as a whole, as a human poly-organism, we have lived the most important and wonderfully complex lives to date. Sentience may be a burden on the individual, a cruel and cold burden, but for sure it is no curse. For it is what makes our society important, instead of simply and any colony filled with workers and rulers devoid of purpose, simply existing because that is the statistical probability of chemicals to form in such a manner, and at such a rate. For that reason I must appreciate the significance of what I’m writing right now. It is not important. It is not going to change anything. But the fact that there are those who may read it and understand that I wrote it as a means of transporting data between two beings, then it is proof that this tiny black box I hold in my hands is more than a waste of time. It is a quintessential part of the human poly-organism, same as you and I, yet it is merely an attachment, an object which I ignore until it becomes obsolete, at which point I will revel in its magnificence, for only then will I know its value. After all it’s nothing special: just a thing thats pretty neat. A cool black box that somebody made. Huh.

    <div style="font-weight: bold;">The Bicycle</div><br>
        <p3>It’s the only thing that really takes my mind off of things these days. It’s funny.. today I was sitting in the dark outside just spinning the front tire while the bike was upside down over and over again. And this will seem stupid but I couldn’t help but notice how beautiful bikes used to be. All the parts were made in Japan: all Shimano everything. The rims were made in France. The frame is tempered steel, lugged together not just welded right as one solid clunky cheap aluminum piece.  There was care put into making the bike which was probably hand made. And you know it wasn’t a particularly high end bicycle. It was just your ordinary run of the mill gravel bike. Nice knobby 26 inch tires on a 1 and 3/8 inch thick rim. The steel Shimano friction shifters are mounted on the Jun stem.  I worked on putting those shifters back together for hours and all the while I’m thinking “why would they put the shifters on the stem?” And I’ve concluded that there really is no good reason. You have to reposition yourself on the bike to change gears, which isn’t good if you’re trying to be quick, or if you’re trying to get yourself out of trouble. But once I got to fixing the bike to a rideable condition, I found that the necessity to shift your seat just so you can change gears made me think about the shifters and how they worked and how the mechanism simply pulls a cable to move the derailer in an analog fashion, not with a locking and clicking way like you’d find commonly on modern bikes. So tonight, I was out in the dark trying to adjust the brakes so they wouldn’t rub on the front wheel. And to test if it would rub, I just spun the wheel. And I wish I could really explain to you the feeling of just sitting there in the dark, spinning the wheel over and over again, thinking that there’s no market value to this bicycle; it’s really just garbage. I could see the wheel wobble as I spun it. And despite the barely noticeable wobble, that wheel spun so smooth and so quiet. And to me, this worthless piece of junk bike that I found at a yard sale in the middle of nowhere rural New York... to me, it was beautiful. And just thinking about how stupid it was that this bicycle made me so happy, I couldn’t help but cry. But It wasn’t a sad cry, nor a happy cry. it wasn’t a poetic cry. It was a laughing kind of cry, an angry kind of laughing cry. I cried because I didn’t know what else to do. I cried because it was funny to me how a simple bicycle could distract me from the loneliness, dread and anxiety I feel.</p3><br><br><br><br>
